# Speaker Notes — Creating an AI Employee

## 1. "If you want something done right, do it yourself."

You know this. But when you grow a business with a team of people... You have to learn to delegate..
You have to build trust with your employees.

## 2. Tom Counsell — Creating an AI Employee

Today we will talk about Creating an AI employee.
I lead software teams and do system architecture. I've built and sold 4 software startups in the last decade, where I was either CTO or CEO.
You're probably familiar with Agoda.com where I led a team and worked on AI.
And the best CEOs delegate and teach. They are teachers.

## 3. CEOs are Teachers

So how is creating an AI employee is similar to developing human staff? When I hired my first assistant I could barely afford it, but honestly the main reason was to intentionally force myself to learn how to delegate and teach.

## 4. Valor LinkedIn

I asked myself: what qualities should my employee have? They should have a name and a face!
So 2 years ago, I created Valor Engels, and yes, he has his own LinkedIn.

## 5. Valor Setup (GitHub + Workstation)

He is provisioned like any human developer on the team.

## 6. Current Abilities

Here's what Valor can actually do today. The most surprising things to people are usually daydream mode, mid-execution steering, and the fact that non-technical coworkers chat with him comfortably.

## 7. "If you can't explain it simply..." — Einstein

People are talking about skills and workflows. This is why process documentation matters. If I can't explain a workflow specifically for Valor to execute it, I will get unexpected results. And that's because I didn't articulate my process.

## 8. Soft Skills

But a great employee is more than a list of capabilities. These are the same qualities I develop in every person I manage. My AI employee is no different.

## 9. Open Source Productions

Valor is now the primary contributor on multiple open source projects. These are the highlights — and several more are on github.com/valorengels.

## 10. "If you can't describe what you are doing as a process..." — Deming

This is the single most important idea behind Valor. Every capability he has started as a process I wrote down, tested, and taught him — just like onboarding a new hire.

## 11. 2026 Expectations

So that's where Valor is today. Here's where I expect him to be by end of 2026. The recursive delegation concept — Valor taking my role and acting through his own agents — is the biggest idea here. Also note: "can pay humans for work" is a provocative reversal. An AI hiring humans.

## 12. What Lasts in an AI World

This is exactly why Valor has a name, a LinkedIn, a personality. These are the things that won't be commoditized.

## 13. 2025 Graveyard

So what do all these have in common?

## 14. 3 Books That Shaped Valor

_(no notes — let the covers speak)_

## 15. "Make it work, make it right, make it fast." — Kent Beck

Another maxim for building things that last is... Make it work - proof of concept, make it right — proper architecture. Then make it fast — latest tooling (Claude Agent SDK)

## 16. 4 Years of Evolution

In a few months, I'll have likely thrown out half his codebase, but I will have honed my taste for what makes a great AI employee.
