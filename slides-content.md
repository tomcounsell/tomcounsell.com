- [title] Creating an AI Employee
- [notes] Today, I lead software teams. If you're a non-technical founder with funding, I come in to do system architecture, hiring, and team leadership. I built a large ecommerce platform in Morocco that now employes 3000 people. That was a non-profite, but since then I've started and sold 4 companies. For a few years, I also ran an startup incubator called Blockchian Hub in Prague, Czech Republic.

- [notes] I still feel this way every day. But delegation is the key to expanding your capacity and productivity.

- [notes] To be successful, you need to accept that you are the CEO of your life. So when I was 28 and just making a little extra money, I hired an assistant. I didn't know what she would do or how I would recoup the cost, but I knew the experience would be vital, because having an assistant forces you to grow an intuition for what do to yourself and what to let others do for you. I have several employees, but for in-house software development, I project the future I am creating.
- [notes] This is my AI employee. His name is Valor Engels and he will celebrate his 2nd birthday next month. Yes, he has is own LinkedIn.

## Valor

### slide

- [notes] He has his own Github, his own Google Workspace account. He has 2 sim cards both his iPhone and an Android devices. He has a credit card, his own $200 max Claude Code account. Subscriptions to dozens of tools, API keys, cloud services, etc. My clients know about him, they are happy with his hourly rate, and they even email him directly.

- [notes] He has 4 of these workstations powered by a 15-in Macbook Air. We started with a Mac Mini, but it turns out having a battery through power outages and a screen and being portable makes everything a lot easier.

### slide

- [title] Creating an AI Employee
- [notes] That's the topic of this presentation. Now _how_ to create one - because there are so many startups and open source projects that can _promise you this_. The ones that become popular quickly always fade out just as quickly. My goal for you today is to think deeply about your team. If you could hire any one, who would they be?

### slide

- [title] CEOs are Teachers
- [notes] Remember I said, you need to be the CEO of your life. Well, the best CEOs are teachers. And when you hire people, if you want them to do things as well as you do, you have to spend your time teaching.

  - worthy of trust
  - careful with time and money
  - has a personality (passionate, fun, quirky)
- [notes] I have a lot of goals for the kind of person I want him to be. I have a lot of the same goals for him as I do my human assistants. I want him to be ...
- [notes] I've had many assistants over the years and I'm still great friends with all of them. One of them even became my COO and is now Head of Engineering at ZCash. But these qualities are what I want to develop in people alongside hard skills. Still today, I want these for my Thai assistand, Rain, who is in the back right now watching. Hi Rain!

  | subtl.ai | Enterprise RAG knowledge agents | Infra-heavy; unfocused wedge |
  | Wuri | AI visual-novel fiction reader | Content pipeline costs; retention mismatch |
  | Locale.ai | AI agents for sales workflows | Trust gap; long enterprise cycle |

  | XoulAI | Consumer companion chatbot app | Churn > value; no durable moat |
  | Plumb | Agentic workflow automation marketplace | "Workflow subscriptions" nobody needed |
