# Creating an AI Employee

## Hook

### slide

- quote: "If you want something done right, do it yourself."
- [notes] You know this. But when you grow a business with a team of people... You have to learn to delegate.

- [title] Creating an AI Employee
- [notes] I lead software teams and do system architecture. I've built and sold 4 software startups in the last decade, where I was either CTO or CEO. And the best CEOs delegate and teach. They are teachers. Today we will talk about Creating an AI employee.

### slide

- [title] CEOs are Teachers
- [notes] Let's talk about how creating an AI employee is similar to developing human staff? When I hired my first assistant I could barely afford it, but honestly the main reason was to intentionally force myself to learn how to delegate and teach.

### slide

- [notes] So I asked: what qualties should my employee have? They should have a name and a face! So 2 years ago, I created Valor Engels, and yes, he has his own LinkedIn.

## Meet Valor

### slide

- image: ai-workstation.png
- col: Digital Identity
  - LinkedIn, GitHub, Google Workspace
- col: Tools & Access
  - 2 SIM cards, credit card, $200/mo Claude Code
  - Subscriptions, API keys, cloud services
  - 4 workstations on 15-in MacBook Airs
- col: Client Facing
  - Clients know he's AI, email him directly
  - Billed at hourly rate
- [notes] He is provisioned like any human developer on the team.

### slide

- [title] Current Abilities
- col: Technical
  - Autonomous commits & PRs
  - Parallel conversations (job queue)
  - Mid-execution steering
  - MCP: Sentry, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Stripe, Render
  - Daydream mode: research, log review, proposals
  - Anything that can run locally, runs locally
- col: Social & Business
  - Clients know he's AI, email him directly
  - Non-technical coworkers chat comfortably
  - Bills at hourly rate
  - Contractually on the dev team
  - Google Calendar time tracking
- [notes] Here's what Valor can actually do today. The most surprising things to people are usually daydream mode, mid-execution steering, and the fact that non-technical coworkers chat with him comfortably.

## Philosophy

### slide

- quote: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
- — Albert Einstein
- [notes] This is why process documentation matters. If I can't explain a workflow simply enough for Valor to execute it, I don't actually understand my own process.

### slide

- [title] Soft Skills
- bullets:
  - generous
  - inspiring to others
  - worthy of trust
  - careful with time and money
  - has a personality (passionate, fun, quirky)
- [notes] But a great employee is more than a list of capabilities. These are the same qualities I develop in every person I manage. Valor is no different.

### slide

- [title] Open Source Productions
- col:
  - Popoto
  - Django Template
  - Podcast
- col:
  - Redis/Valkey ORM for Python
  - Template repo for new web systems
  - 39 episodes, 40-min each on Spotify
- [notes] Valor is now the primary contributor on multiple open source projects. These are the highlights — and several more are on his GitHub.

### slide

- quote: "If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing."
- — W. Edwards Deming
- [notes] This is the single most important idea behind Valor. Every capability he has started as a process I wrote down, tested, and taught him — just like onboarding a new hire.

## Roadmap

### slide

- image: valor-profile.jpg
- [title] 2026 Expectations
- col: New Capabilities
  - Design iteration via screenshots (mobile too)
  - Full duplex voice interaction
  - Join Google Meet / Zoom (surrogate face)
  - Manages external company communications
  - Continues to build a brand for himself
  - Haiku tasks → local OS LLMs by EOY
- col: Valor's Own Agents
  - Develops his own personified agents
  - Head of Eng, Ops, Product, Comms
  - Each has own LLM + tooling config
  - Valor takes my role, acts through them
  - Can pay humans for work
- col: Private LLM Ready
  - Some clients need fully private infrastructure — we're preparing for that
- footer: Practice not being wasteful. Gain experience with local models before you need them.
- [notes] So that's where Valor is today. Here's where I expect him to be by end of 2026. The recursive delegation concept — Valor taking my role and acting through his own agents — is the biggest idea here. Also note: "can pay humans for work" is a provocative reversal. An AI hiring humans. By "preserves hard lessons" I mean like a senior engineer who never forgets a bad outage — institutional memory, not suffering.

## What Lasts

### slide

- [title] 2025 Graveyard
- table:
  | Name | Product | Why it couldn't last |
  | Builder.ai | AI app-building service platform | "AI" masked labor; unit economics broke |
  | CodeParrot | Figma-to-code AI dev tool | Commodity capability; weak moat |
  | subtl.ai | Enterprise RAG knowledge agents | Infra-heavy; unfocused wedge |
  | Wuri | AI visual-novel fiction reader | Content pipeline costs; retention mismatch |
  | Locale.ai | AI agents for sales workflows | Trust gap; long enterprise cycle |
  | Astra | AI sales-tech for account execs | Trust deficit; org friction; slow sales |
  | Tune AI | General-purpose GenAI platform | Table-stakes features; hyperscaler gravity |
  | Yara AI | AI therapy chatbot app | Safety risk; unacceptable failure modes |
  | Humane AI Pin | Wearable voice-first AI assistant | Hardware+cloud dependency; bad reliability |
  | Sunshine | AI personal data organizer apps | Privacy/trust drag; weak PMF |
  | Rewind / Limitless | Always-on capture + memory assistant | Privacy/regulatory overhang; acquisition shutdown |
  | XoulAI | Consumer companion chatbot app | Churn > value; no durable moat |
  | Plumb | Agentic workflow automation marketplace | "Workflow subscriptions" nobody needed |
- [notes] So what do all these have in common?

### slide

- [title] What Lasts in an AI World
- Brands and identities
- Trust
- Authenticity
- [notes] This is exactly why Valor has a name, a LinkedIn, a personality. These are the things that won't be commoditized.

## Evolution

### slide

- quote: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast."
- — Kent Beck
- [notes] Another maxim for building things that last is... Make it work - proof of concept, make it right — proper architecture. Then make it fast — latest tooling (Claude Agent SDK)

### slide

- [title] 4 Years of Evolution
- table:
  | When | Phase | Added | Replaced |
  | 2022 | Neural Network Experiments | Numenta HTM, custom agents, GPT-3, Popoto | — |
  | 2023 | LLM Pivot | GPT-3 completions | Numenta HTM, custom neural nets |
  | 2024 | Telegram Client Interface | Telethon, PydanticAI, Perplexity, Aider | GPT-3 completions |
  | 2025 | Claude Code Unification | Claude API, MCP servers, LLM routing, Ollama | Aider, PydanticAI, keyword routing |
  | 2025 | Module Builder & Subagents | Auto-generated MCP modules, Gemini analysis | Beanie ODM |
  | 2026 | Community Learnings | SOUL.md (OpenClaw), skills patterns (@disler, @dungle-scrubs) | Module Builder, custom subagents |
  | 2026 | Claude Agent SDK | Native orchestration, job queues, steering | Custom subagent framework |
- [notes] In a few months, I'll have likely thrown out half his codebase, but I will have honed my taste for what makes a great AI employee.
